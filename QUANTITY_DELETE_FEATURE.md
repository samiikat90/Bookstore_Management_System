# Quantity-Based Delete Feature Summary

## New Functionality Added

### Enhanced Delete Feature
The delete function now supports **quantity-based deletion** instead of only complete book removal.

### How It Works

1. **Click Delete Button**: Click the red "Delete" button next to any book in the catalog
2. **Enter Quantity**: A prompt appears asking how many copies to delete
   - Default value is the current quantity (for complete deletion)
   - You can enter any number from 1 to the current quantity
3. **Confirmation**: A second dialog confirms your action with clear messaging
4. **Result**: Either partial quantity reduction or complete book removal

### Two Deletion Modes

#### Partial Deletion
- **When**: Delete quantity < current quantity
- **Action**: Reduces book quantity by specified amount
- **Result**: Book remains in catalog with updated quantity
- **Example**: Delete 5 copies from a book with 10 → 5 copies remain

#### Complete Deletion
- **When**: Delete quantity = current quantity
- **Action**: Completely removes book from database
- **Result**: Book no longer appears in catalog
- **Example**: Delete all 10 copies → Book completely removed

### Safety Features

✅ **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid quantities (negative, zero, or exceeding available)  
✅ **Pending Order Protection**: Blocks complete deletion if pending orders exist  
✅ **Double Confirmation**: Two-step process prevents accidental deletion  
✅ **Clear Messaging**: Different messages for partial vs complete deletion  
✅ **Manager Authentication**: Requires admin login with 2FA  

### Example Use Cases

- **Damage Control**: Remove damaged copies while keeping good ones
- **Partial Returns**: Reduce inventory after returning some copies to supplier
- **Theft/Loss**: Account for missing inventory without losing the book record
- **Inventory Adjustment**: Fine-tune quantities for accurate counts
- **Complete Removal**: Delete entire book when discontinuing

### Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: Enhanced `delete_book()` route with quantity parameter validation
- **Frontend**: Interactive JavaScript prompts with current quantity display
- **Database**: Smart handling of quantity updates vs complete deletion
- **Validation**: Comprehensive error checking and user feedback

The feature maintains all existing security and safety measures while adding flexible quantity management!
