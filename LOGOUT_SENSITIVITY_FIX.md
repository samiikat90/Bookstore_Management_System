# Auto-Logout Sensitivity Fix

## Problem Fixed
The automatic logout was too sensitive and was logging users out when they clicked "Back to Dashboard" or navigated between pages within the application.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used multiple aggressive event listeners:
- `beforeunload` (triggered on ANY page change)
- `visibilitychange` (triggered when switching tabs/windows)
- `pagehide` (triggered on navigation)

This caused logout on normal navigation within the app.

## Solution Implemented

### Smart Navigation Detection
```javascript
let isNavigating = false;

// Detect clicks on internal links
document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  const link = event.target.closest('a');
  if (link && link.href && link.href.includes(window.location.origin)) {
    isNavigating = true;
    setTimeout(function() {
      isNavigating = false;
    }, 1000);
  }
});
```

### Selective Logout Trigger
```javascript
// Only logout if NOT navigating within the app
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function(event) {
  if (!isNavigating) {
    performLogout();
  }
});
```

## Changes Made

### Removed Aggressive Listeners
- ❌ `visibilitychange` event (caused logout on tab switching)
- ❌ `pagehide` event (caused logout on navigation)
- ❌ Direct `beforeunload` calls (too broad)

### Added Smart Detection
- ✅ Navigation tracking for internal links
- ✅ Origin-based link detection
- ✅ Timeout reset for navigation flag
- ✅ Conditional logout only when not navigating

## Updated Templates
- `admin_dashboard.html` - Fixed overly sensitive logout
- `catalog.html` - Fixed overly sensitive logout  
- `edit_book.html` - Fixed overly sensitive logout

## User Experience Now

### ✅ Normal Navigation (No Logout)
- Clicking "Back to Dashboard" ✅
- Navigating between admin pages ✅
- Using menu links ✅
- Form submissions ✅
- Page refreshes ✅

### ❌ Still Triggers Logout
- Closing browser window ❌
- Closing browser tab ❌
- Navigating to external websites ❌
- Typing new URL in address bar ❌

## Testing Results
- **Internal Navigation**: No more unwanted logouts
- **Dashboard Links**: Work without signing out
- **Browser Close**: Still properly logs out
- **Security**: Maintains protection against abandoned sessions

The auto-logout feature now works as intended - providing security without interfering with normal app usage!
